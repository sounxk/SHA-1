# SHA-1

An implementation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm in pure python. 

This library was designed to demonstrate a straight-forward implementation of
the algortihm, and is not designed for speed. The current implementation
matches the [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) api.
